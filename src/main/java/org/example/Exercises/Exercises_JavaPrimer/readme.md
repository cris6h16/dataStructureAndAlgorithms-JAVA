# 1.10 Exercises

## Reinforcement

1. **R-1.1**:
   Write a short Java method, `inputAllBaseTypes`, that inputs a different
   value of each base type from the standard input device and prints it
   back to the standard output devices  
   [First solved](First.java)


2. **R-1.2**:
   Supposed that we created an array `A` of `GameEntry` objects, which has an integer score field, and we clone `A` and
   store result in an array `B`.
   If we then immediately set `A[4].score` equal to `550`, what is the score value of the `GameEntry` object at `B[4]`?  
   [Second solved](Second.java)  


3. **R-1.3**:
   Write a short Java method, `isMultiple`, that takes two long values, `n` and `m`, and returns `true` if and only if `n`
   is a multiple of `m`, that is, `n = mi` for some integer `i`, and `false` otherwise.  
   [Third solved](Third.java)  


4. **R-1.4**:
    Write a short Java method, `isEven`, that takes an int `i` and returns `true` if and only if `i` is even. Your method cannot use the multiplication, modulus, or division operations, however.   
    [Fourth solved](Fourth.java)  


5. **R-1.5**:
    Write a short Java method that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.  
    [Fifth solved](Fifth.java)
