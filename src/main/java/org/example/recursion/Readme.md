Recursion exercises

- Write a recursive function that computes the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, where n is given as parameter.

        //return the sum 1+ 2+ 3+ ...+ n
        int sum(int n)

- Write a recursive function that finds and returns the minimum element in an array, where the array and its size are given as parameters.

      //return the minimum element in a[]
      int findmin(int a[], int n)

- Write a recursive function that computes and returns the sum of all elements in an array, where the array and its size are given as parameters.

      //return the sum of all elements in a[]
      int findsum(int a[], int n)

- Write a recursive function that determines whether an array is a palindrome, where the array and its size are given as parameters.

      //returns 1 if a[] is a palindrome, 0 otherwise
      int ispalindrome(char a[], int n)

- Write a recursive function that searches for a target in a sorted array using binay search, where the array, its size and the target are given as parameters.
