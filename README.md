I want to mension that All of here are just practice, I took notes of the foundamental and relevant concepts on my personal digital NoteBook. In a future I try to add about graphs and document more (specificly the boundary cases of each)  
##  
I also am trying to combine with the book( only practices ):  
_"Data Structures and Algorithms in Java" by Michael T. Goodrich (Author), Roberto Tamassia (Author), Michael H. Goldwasser_.    
But this I'll do slowly because I do it when:
- My teacher doesn't come & I have free hour
- When I don't have Internet || Energy && I have charged my laptop
- Any other moments in which I can't choose what do
